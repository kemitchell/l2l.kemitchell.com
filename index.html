    <p>why lawyers won’t talk to the other side alone</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>In the United States, professional rules that lawyers have to follow prohibit them from writing or talking to people they know have their own lawyers without those lawyers present.  If you ask a lawyer to send an e-mail to the business people on the other side of a deal, they will want to make sure they are copying a lawyer on that side.  If you ask a lawyer to attend a call with business people on the other side, they will want to make sure a lawyer for that side also joins.</p>
    <p>“Lawyers talk to lawyers. Business people talk to business people.”</p>
    <p>Lawyers get their licenses to practice law from the bar association of their state.  Each bar association has its own rules, so they can vary state to state.  However, most states’ bar associations use some version of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct from the ABA.</p>
