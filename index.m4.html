    <p>In the United States, professional rules that lawyers have to follow prohibit them from writing or talking to people they know have their own lawyers without those lawyers present.</p>
    <p>If you ask a lawyer to send an e-mail to the business people on the other side of a deal, they will want to make sure they are copying a lawyer on that side. If you ask a lawyer to attend a call with business people on the other side, they will want to make sure a lawyer for that side also joins.</p>
    <h2>Says who?</h2>
    <p>Lawyers get their licenses to practice law from the bar association of their state. Each bar association has its own rules, so they can vary state to state. However, most states’ bar associations use some version of the ABA’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

      <h4>Rule 4.2: Communication with Person Represented by Counsel</h4>
      <p>In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized to do so by law or a court order.</p>
